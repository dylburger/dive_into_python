import <module>

    A module is a chunk of Python code
    After importing, you have access to a module's public functions, classes and helpers

    In [13]: sys
    Out[13]: <module 'sys' (built-in)>

    Built-in modules are not Python code, and therefore the code isn't stored in .py files. Built-in modules are likely to be written in C (sys is), and they're baked right into Python itself

Remember - EVERYTHING is an object in Python

    In the Python sense, this just means that objects can be assigned to variables or that you can pass it as an argument to a function

In Python, blocks are delimited by a colon, and the indentation of the code that follows

if __name__ == "__main__"

    This is a trick we can use to execute test code in a given module if the module was run as a standalone program
        If we import the module and use it in another program, __name__ will hold the value of the module name
        If we run the module as a standalone script, the value of __name__ will be "__main__"
